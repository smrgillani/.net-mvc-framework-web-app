<h2 class="page_sub_headings_">About Dar-e-Arqam</h2>
<p class="page_sub_contents_">
    Being submissive and humble to the will of Almighty ALLAH, we relate this institution to the very first educational centre of Islam, “Dar-e-Arqam” established at Hazrat Arqam Bin Arqam’s house in the plains of Koh-e-Safa by Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W). The Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) gets his believers gathered in a small house and laid the foundation of rich civilization that produced marvelous blessings and countless human role models.

    Contrary to the present Soulless system of education based on aimless, materialistic and secular approach, the edifice of Dar-e-Arqam System of education is constructed with the bricks, stones and cement of Faith, Sincerity and Sublime Aims and is beautified with active modern scientific ideas about education to equip the innocent saplings of the future tree, with the latest branches of learning so that they can converse with the teachings of the Holy Quran and Sunnah side by side with the modern education, and when grown up can raise the status of “Ummah” and take them out of the abyss of darkness.

    <h2 class="page_sub_headings_s_">History</h2>
<p class="page_sub_contents_"> 
    The first Dar-e-Arqam School was established in Sargodha in 1991. Then, like minded people gathered and spread the rays of knowledge in a very short time. These schools are progressing and increasing in number tremendously. Right now, The Dar-e-Arqam school is one of the largest growing school systems with more than 50,000 students and more than 230 branches all over Pakistan. This appreciation and recognition by the society is more because of its unique way of imparting modern education with Islamic perspective. Alhamdulillah, many achievements have been made so far in the different areas of curricular and co-curricular activity. The journey towards excellence is on very rapidly and every achievement is a beacon of light and source of inspiration. The practical problems are no doubt there but they don't come in the way of our enthusiastic and strict and dedicated team of selfless and honest workers. These challenges are like opportunities for us and gives us guidance and tips for future planning.
