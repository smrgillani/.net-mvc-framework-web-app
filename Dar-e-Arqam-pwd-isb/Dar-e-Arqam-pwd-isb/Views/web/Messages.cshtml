    <p class="page_sub_contents_">Our beloved country Pakistan is the name of a geographical territory based on the ideology of Islam. It is heartening to note that our enemy is bent upon damaging our ideology as well as our ideological heritage.</p>
    <p class="page_sub_contents_">To cope with this state of affairs we need a lot of educational and ethical power besides all kinds of material sources. It is a matter of historical truth that the nations equipped with high moral values are undefeatable.</p>
    <p class="page_sub_contents_"> Dar-e-Arqam is a name of total committment and strong dedication, to achieve the sublime quality of moral excellence through the education of body and soul. </p>
